imagine if i knew about nodemon and this
const baseURL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
  ? 'http://localhost:5000'
  : 'https://api.lolgiss.com';

fetch(${baseURL}/api/stats)

I got daily answer logic in frontend and realized now that im older and wiser that i should be in backend to prevent cheating. 

saving targetchamp in DB for every single guess instead of once per day and using that info.
